# Neighborhood Map Project 8

## Project description
    
    This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and axios.
    This is a webpage showing my neighborhood map listing the cafees in the center of Athens. The map is generated by Google Maps API and also Foursquare API gives the location and information of each coffee place. 

## General Instructions

Development Mode

    Download or Clone the Repository.
    Install all project dependencies with npm install
    Start the server with npm start

Production Mode

    To create a production build use npm run build
    Navigate to the build directory and start the server with npm run deploy
    This mode includes a Service Worker. So in production, we register a service worker to serve assets from local cache.
